### System Description:

We all struggle to find the best outfit to wear to events. We forget the clothes in our closets when we shop for new pieces. We even forget which garments look best with others. 

Lanique's Closet System is a closet management system for young adults that eliminates decision fatigue. This database system will organize garments within your closet.

For Lanique's Closet System, the user will manually enter images of their clothing and its description into our system. Our system will then organize the data based on the type of garment, its color, season, and event. Each garment will have a mapping to other items within their closet that work well with that piece based on user input.

Our service will automate different clothing choices based on the user’s daily events and weather conditions with the support of external data collection via weather.com and from their digital calendars such as Google Calendar.
